### HOVERING OVER CATEGORIES

1. Prescribing
   - Prescriptions are received by the staff of a pharmacy through a physical prescription dropped off, or through the doctor’s office from fax or electronic prescribing. They are then prepared by technicians or assistants for the next step
2. Prescription Entry
   - Prescriptions are scanned and inputted into the pharmacy’s electronic system. Technicians and assistants are responsible for interpreting the prescription and making sure that the information matches what is being entered into the electronic system. Pharmacists will check at this point to verify the information is correct, as well as making initial checks to make sure that the information makes sense. Labels and instructions are then printed, and the drug is billed to any insurance companies for payment
3. Preparation/Dispensing
   - Staff will proceed to fill medications with the stock that is available in the pharmacy. Medications are compounded and counted, labels are matched with the medications, and blister packs are created at this point.
   - At this point, the final product is checked by a pharmacist or technician to make sure it matches the original prescription. The prescription undergoes one last step to verify that the medication is safe and effective for the person taking it.
4. Administration
   - Person picks up the medication from the pharmacy, and takes the drug as directed by the pharmacy
5. Monitoring/Follow-up
   - Pharmacist is to assess of there are any side effects, allergic reaction, or any unwanted reaction to the medication.

1. Prescribing

   Roughly 9% of medication errors occurred during the prescribing phase. One of the most common errors that happen is if a dosage of a drug is not appropriate for the person taking it.

   ### Common Problem: Dosing a drug for a child

   Children are at a high risk of medication errors mainly because the amount of drug that they should receive highly depends on their age and weight. Not only that, but medication errors in children are **3 times** more likely to cause death or disability compared to adults. A study on children's prescriptions in community pharmacies showed that obtaining a weight for a child was difficult, and that only 32% of pharmacists calculated a weight-based dose to check a prescription.

   One of the most common mistakes that can happen in a pharmacy is during the interpretation of an incoming prescription. Illegible handwriting or misinterpretation of language can often cause the wrong drug or dosage to be dispensed. While there are many checks and balances to prevent these mistakes from reaching you, you are most likely going to see an error from a handwritten prescription.

   ## Solution: Mandatory electronic prescriptions

   Electronic prescriptions allows for a direct connection from the doctor's office to your local pharmacy. Health Canada estimates that approximately **700** deaths can be prevented if electronic prescriptions are mandated in pharmacies. As of 2020, more than 12 states in the USA mandate electronic prescriptions for narcotic drugs. While most pharmacies in Canada have the capacity to take electronic prescriptions, most pharmacies still heavily rely on paper or faxes.
