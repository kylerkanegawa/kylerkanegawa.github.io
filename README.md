*In a pharmacy, there are many different steps that occur from the moment that you drop off your prescription, to the time that you pick up the medications. Each step of the pipeline has the potential for errors to occur. Click on each step to learn more about each section of the pipeline!*

### HOVERING OVER CATEGORIES

1. Prescribing
   - Prescriptions are received by the staff of a pharmacy through a physical prescription dropped off, or through the doctor’s office from fax or electronic prescribing. They are then prepared by technicians or assistants for the next step
2. Prescription Entry
   - Prescriptions are scanned and inputted into the pharmacy’s electronic system. Technicians and assistants are responsible for interpreting the prescription and making sure that the information matches what is being entered into the electronic system. Pharmacists will check at this point to verify the information is correct, as well as making initial checks to make sure that the information makes sense. Labels and instructions are then printed, and the drug is billed to any insurance companies for payment
3. Preparation/Dispensing
   - Staff will proceed to fill medications with the stock that is available in the pharmacy. Medications are compounded and counted, labels are matched with the medications, and blister packs are created at this point.
   - At this point, the final product is checked by a pharmacist or technician to make sure it matches the original prescription. The prescription undergoes one last step to verify that the medication is safe and effective for the person taking it.
4. Administration
   - Person picks up the medication from the pharmacy, and takes the drug as directed by the pharmacy
5. Monitoring/Follow-up
   - Pharmacist is to assess of there are any side effects, allergic reaction, or any unwanted reaction to the medication.

1. Prescribing

   Roughly 9% of medication errors occurred during the prescribing phase. One of the most common errors that happen is if a dosage of a drug is not appropriate for the person taking it.

   ### Common Problem: Dosing a drug for a child

   ![image](https://github.com/kylerkanegawa/kylerkanegawa.github.io/blob/master/pediatricdosing.jpg?raw=true)

   Children are at a high risk of medication errors mainly because the amount of drug that they should receive highly depends on their age and weight. Not only that, but medication errors in children are **3 times** more likely to cause death or disability compared to adults. A study on children's prescriptions in community pharmacies showed that obtaining a weight for a child was difficult, and that only 32% of pharmacists calculated a weight-based dose to check a prescription.

   > source: Condren *et al.* The Fate of Pediatric Prescriptions in Community Pharmacies *Journal of patient safety*. 2015;11:79-88.

   ## Solution: Access to lab records and a person's Electronic medical records (EMR)

   While information such as a child's weight could be attained by either talking to the parent or talking to the doctor, some possible solutions could include having a connected system with the person's electronic medical records or EMR. In some provinces such as Alberta, pharmacists could access current lab records and be able to find information such as weight from these documents. Having access to this information will allow pharmacists to be a more informed asset to the health team, and to be able to double check child doses of drugs as soon as they receive them.

2. Prescription Entry

   Over 58% of errors were reported to occur in this stage. The most common error that was made was an incorrect dose or an incorrect quantity.

   ### Common Pitfall: Interpreting a handwritten prescription

   > Source: [The End Is Near for Illegible Handwritten Prescriptions in New York (nymag.com)](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/03/new-york-eliminating-handwritten-prescriptions.html)

   One of the most common mistakes that can happen in a pharmacy is during the interpretation of an incoming prescription. Illegible handwriting or misinterpretation of language can often cause the wrong drug or dosage to be dispensed. While there are many checks and balances to prevent these mistakes from reaching you, you are most likely going to see an error from a handwritten prescription.

   ## Solution: Mandatory electronic prescriptions

   Electronic prescriptions allows for a direct connection from the doctor's office to your local pharmacy. Health Canada estimates that approximately **700** deaths can be prevented if electronic prescriptions are mandated in pharmacies. As of 2020, more than 12 states in the USA mandate electronic prescriptions for narcotic drugs. While most pharmacies in Canada have the capacity to take electronic prescriptions, most pharmacies still heavily rely on paper or faxes.

   

3. Preparation/Dispensing

   ![image](https://github.com/kylerkanegawa/kylerkanegawa.github.io/blob/master/blisterpack.jpg?raw=true)

   Up to 29.3% of medication errors occur during the packaging and dispensing phase. Pharmacists, technicians, and assistants work hard to with many layers of protection to make sure that the drug that is prescribed is the drug that you get. 

   ## Problem: packaging and dispensing has a human error element to it that should be addressed

   For some lucky pharmacies, much of this process can be automated (LINK TO PAGE ABOUT AUTOMATIC DISPENSING SYSTEMS). For some less fortunate pharmacies, the team is unfortunately spread too thin, and mistakes are more likely to occur. There are ways to make sure that mistakes are less likely to occur.

   ## Mandate TALLman lettering and safe abbreviations

   ### TALLman lettering

   Pharmacists are trained and equipped to be able to differentiate between similar sounding drugs. But in the fast pace of a community pharmacist, it is easy to make a mistake between two similar sounding drugs. As an example, try differentiating between the following list of drugs:

   `hydralazine, hydroxyzine, hydromorphone, HCTZ (hydrochlorothiazide), HCTZ (hydroxychloroquine)`

   TALLman lettering is a simple method of using font and upper-case letters to differentiate between similar sounding drugs. For example:

   `hydrALAZINE, hydOXYzine, HYDROmorphone`

   

   ### Safe abbreviations

   [The Institute for Safe Medication Practices has a thorough list of abbreviations that are considered dangerous and should not be used in medicine](https://www.ismp.org/recommendations/error-prone-abbreviations-list)

### Quality Process and Reporting Systems ###

Medication error reporting systems are an important tool to improve patient safety in community pharmacies. By reporting quality related events (QREs), healthcare professionals are able to investigate the cause of the incident to prevent future occurrences. Based on the reported data, community pharmacies are able to implement system-based strategies for quality improvement. A robust error reporting system creates a patient safety culture.

> **Fig 1**: Error reporting systems enhance patient safety in a community pharmacy. When a quality related event occurs, it is reported to a central database. The central database will analyze the reported data to identify common or major quality related events. As a result, patient safety information sources (e.g., websites, safety bulletins, online tools) will be derived from QRE reporting. Patient safety information sources will be communicated to community pharmacies across the province to implement continuous quality improvement processes; thus, enhancing patient safety (Barker et al., 2019).

### **Guiding Principles and Characteristics of an Effective Medication Error Reporting System** ###

1. Provide a choice of reporter anonymity
2. Provide confidentiality of reported information
3. Define a nonpunitive approach to reporting
4. Encourage reporting of both potential and actual errors and of patient injuries stemming from errors 
5. Provide feedback of error analysis and timely recommendations
6. Ease of use (i.e., minimize the number of screens)
7. Availability of both electronic and paper formats
8. Standard taxonomy
9. Severity of outcomes
10. Allow all pharmacy team members to report medication errors
11. Searchable and retrievable data (i.e., checkboxes or drop-downs)
12. Allow generation of patient safety information sources from reported data Cost effective (Boyle et al., 2011)
