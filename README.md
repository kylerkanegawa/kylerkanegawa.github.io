### HOVERING OVER CATEGORIES

1. Prescribing
   - Prescriptions are received by the staff of a pharmacy through a physical prescription dropped off, or through the doctor’s office from fax or electronic prescribing. They are then prepared by technicians or assistants for the next step
2. Prescription Entry
   - Prescriptions are scanned and inputted into the pharmacy’s electronic system. Technicians and assistants are responsible for interpreting the prescription and making sure that the information matches what is being entered into the electronic system. Pharmacists will check at this point to verify the information is correct, as well as making initial checks to make sure that the information makes sense. Labels and instructions are then printed, and the drug is billed to any insurance companies for payment
3. Preparation/Dispensing
   - Staff will proceed to fill medications with the stock that is available in the pharmacy. Medications are compounded and counted, labels are matched with the medications, and blister packs are created at this point.
   - At this point, the final product is checked by a pharmacist or technician to make sure it matches the original prescription. The prescription undergoes one last step to verify that the medication is safe and effective for the person taking it.
4. Administration
   - Person picks up the medication from the pharmacy, and takes the drug as directed by the pharmacy
5. Monitoring/Follow-up
   - Pharmacist is to assess of there are any side effects, allergic reaction, or any unwanted reaction to the medication.
