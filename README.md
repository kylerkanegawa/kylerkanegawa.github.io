# Exploring the interface between Molecular Genetics and Data Science

In 2017/2018, I participated and graduated from the UBC science Co-op program with experience in both bacterial culture and antibody generation. My interests involve working with immunotherapy, diagnostic research with NGS data, and clinical onco-genomics.
